The only keyboard you'll ever need.

## What is godboard?
Cheap, efficient and appeals to the best part about keyboards: knobs. You wanted knobs on your keyboard? Well this keyboard is literally just one knob 
and a button. Welcome to the future of keyboards.

## How does this marvel of modern invention work?
I'm glad you asked, and thanks for the compliment. Using a potentiometer, we can let the user adjust resistance through a knob, which we can measure by the 
voltage coming out in analog form. This is sent to an ADC chip that converts this analog data to a digital signal that is sent to a Raspberry Pi. We 
record the volts in software and convert that to characters. We also listen for the button press on GPIO pin 25 to confirm using the current character.
